# AP Coder at scale: targets, measurements and progress

The goal is in [SCALE_GOAL.md](SCALE_GOAL.md):
- 300–400 people at once and about 25,000 invoices a month (1,250 a day, 300,000 a year);
- one company server (a Windows VM, 32 vCPU, 64 GB), with the AI models on a separate machine over the network;
- the pilot itself on one Mac mini.

What the code was like when the goal started is in [archive/scale-2026-11/DIGEST.md](archive/scale-2026-11/DIGEST.md),
with seven notes beside it.

Every number here was measured, with the machine, the command and the date. Estimates are marked *estimate*.

## The machine the numbers come from
- **Where they come from:** a 4-core Linux container (shared, so on the slow side), Python 3.11, no graphics card.
- **The real-server figures** (32 vCPU) are a projection from the per-core numbers until they are measured on the
  real server.
- **The models:** played by the bench's stand-in model server, `python -m ap_coder.bench fake-model`, with set
  delays, slots and failures.

## Why 100,000 invoices and not 300,000 on this machine
- **The size:** a seeded database (`python -m ap_coder.bench seed`) takes 22–32 KB an invoice:
  - the invoice row itself about 12 KB (the coding as read 3.6, as approved 3.5, the checks 2.0);
  - its capture 2.1;
  - events 1.75;
  - feedback 1.4;
  - the summary and search 2.6;
  - the JD Edwards register 1.2;
  - the full learning history about 9 KB more for each approved invoice.
- **The two seeds:** 100,000 invoices (600,000 register rows) came to 2.2 GB with learning rows for 5% of approvals, and 3.25 GB in the current seed. A year, 300,000, would be about 7–9 GB. This machine's whole disk allowance leaves about 3 GB for data.
- **So the numbers here are at 100,000 invoices,** about four months at 25,000 a month, with a scaling check against 12,000:
  - each page's time at 12k and at 100k;
  - no full scan of a big table on a hot path, guarded by tests.
  - A page that only seeks indexes adds about one B-tree level from 100k to 300k. A page that scans grows threefold, and the scaling check is what catches it.
- **Stage 2's real server measures a year's database itself** (docs/SERVER.md).

## Targets (the goal's "Done means")

| # | Target | Baseline | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100 simulated people on 4 cores, 300k invoices (here 100k): pages p50 ≤ 300 ms, p95 ≤ 1.5 s, p99 ≤ 3 s; actions p95 ≤ 1 s; 0 errors, 0 "database is locked"; memory flat for an hour (stretch: 200 people) | **Not met.** Pages p50 27 s, p95 140 s, p99 167 s; actions p95 120 s (the timeout); 577 requests with no answer, 6 5xx at the client and 80 in the server's log, 2 "database is locked", 7 logins refused; web workers grew to 3.4–6.9 GB each and were killed for memory (12 started to keep 4) | |
| 2 | One person, 300k invoices (here 100k): every page ≤ 300 ms; reports and exports ≤ 3 s or a job; no full scans on hot paths | **Not met.** 165 addresses as Admin and Clerk: 43 over target, 45 full scans of big tables, 0 errors. Pages: median 60 ms, but 24 of 108 over 300 ms (Activity 12–20 s, Learning → Suppliers 8 s, Import invoices 6–8 s, Settings → Automation 4.7 s, an invoice 0.7 s with 689 statements). Reports and exports: Spend workbook 251 s, Month-end 202 s and its accruals CSV 195 s, Report a problem 22 s, the controls report 17 s, the duplicates CSV 14 s, search to Excel 8.6 s | |
| 3 | 1,250 invoices (half scans) dropped at once: read the same day, web p95 unchanged; the model machine killed, hung or swapped: nothing lost or doubled, failover in under a minute | **Borderline, and no failover.** 100 invoices, half scans, through `serve --server --workers 4` with the stand-in model (8–20 s a page, 2 slots, time ×0.05): all read, 0 failures. At full latency (estimate): arrival 184 an hour, because the import runs one at a time in a web worker (1.8 cores) and asks the chat model on arrival. The reader drains 100 in 43 min. So 1,250 would take about 6.8 h to arrive and 9 h to read: inside a day only just. `GET /review` p95 89 ms during the drop. Failover to a backup model: not supported. Drills: the model killed, nothing lost (42 s recovery); hung, the import stalls 30 s (600 s in production) for each suggestion | |
| 4 | JD Edwards (stand-in): sync of 30k suppliers and 600k vouchers, then only the changes; 500 vouchers in one run; the duplicate check right beside a 20k-voucher supplier; fiscal periods | **Not met** (no volume harness yet: phase 4 builds it). By reading and small reproductions: every nightly read stops at 100,000 rows (200 pages × 500), so 600k vouchers fail every night. Each night re-reads 730 days. Posting stops at the first late voucher (about 40 h for 500 at worst). One 20k-voucher supplier switched the live check off for everyone (B-1601, fixed in phase 1). No fiscal periods | |
| 5 | macOS service proven in CI; readiness check; updates under 5 minutes of downtime; backups pruned, with a free-space check | — | |
| 6 | No SQL outside `core/store`; nested transactions; a PostgreSQL seam; meta tests | — | |
| 7 | Every reproduced bug fixed test-first | 0 of about 20 | |
| 8 | Laptop mode unchanged; accuracy benches the same or better; `same_behaviour.py` identical | — | |
| 9 | Docs current | — | |

## Progress by phase
- **Phase 0, measure first** (5 Nov 2026; PR #92):
  - **The tools:** `bench seed`, `volume`, `load`, `fake-model` and `day`, plus the research (D-148).
  - **The load baseline on 100k invoices,** 100 people, 4 web workers, 10 minutes after a 1-minute ramp, measured with
    the corrected harness (timeouts and cut-off requests counted at their elapsed time):
    - **It collapses:** requests a second fall from 44 in the first minute (the logins) to 12 in the third and 1–3
      from the fifth, as workers grow past 3 GB and are killed.
    - **The slowest, at the server (p95):** `GET /process` (it reads every invoice file), `GET /review` (it re-checks
      the queue), `GET /exports`, `GET /month-end`, `GET /search` and `POST /review/{id}/check`. The figures are in the
      report.
    - **The full report:** [archive/scale-2026-11/baseline-load-100-people.md](archive/scale-2026-11/baseline-load-100-people.md).
  - **The volume baseline at 100k, one person:**
    - [archive/scale-2026-11/baseline-volume-100k.md](archive/scale-2026-11/baseline-volume-100k.md), in the target 2 row
      above;
    - measured with phase 1's agents on the same 4 cores, so it's on the slow side (the reports take minutes, so noise
      doesn't change what is over target).
  - **The throughput baseline:** [archive/scale-2026-11/baseline-day-100.md](archive/scale-2026-11/baseline-day-100.md), in
    the target 3 row above.
  - **The first target for phase 2:** a web worker's memory on a big database.
