# Decisions

The significant choices behind AP Coder. D-01 to D-124, in full (the choice, why, and where it is written or
enforced): [archive/decisions-2026-10.md](archive/decisions-2026-10.md); look one up with
`grep -n -A8 "D-34\b" docs/archive/decisions-*.md`. Below, one line each.

A new choice: the next number (`grep -o "D-[0-9]*" docs/decisions.md | sort -t- -k2 -n | tail -1`), written in full
at the end of the last section here (lines at most 120 characters); say so in the pull request. Never renumber. A
choice that is reversed keeps its line, marked "replaced by D-NN".

- **D-123** · The five longest functions in named steps, no behaviour change
- **D-124** · Fewer connections a page; a before/after harness for refactors (scripts/same_behaviour.py)
- **D-125** · The bug log and the decisions are short files; their past is archived. `docs/BUGS.md` holds the bugs
  from B-1442 and `docs/decisions.md` one line per decision, each choice made from now on in full; B-01 to B-1441
  (287 KB) and D-01 to D-124 in full (170 KB) are in `docs/archive/`, which `.ignore` keeps out of ripgrep and the
  Grep tool's searches (an agent's search for a word in the code no longer lands in 450 KB of history; a number is
  looked up there by name). Why: both files were read whole, searched and appended to on most changes. Benches take
  `--quick` (`bench/__main__.py` `QUICK`) for a check in a minute or two. `tests/meta/test_agent_friendly.py` keeps
  the last numbers findable in the short files.
- **D-126** · A line is split across GL accounts (cost centers) by percentage or by dollar amount, from a split
  button on every line (beside Delete; left out of Tab's way, B-478) as well as *Split a line…* under the table
  and the line's right-click menu. By amount, the parts are the amounts typed, to the cent, each of the line's sign
  (minus on a credit note), and must add up to the line; the description says "(500.00 of 890.00)". Why: the pilot
  tester asked for a line's cost shared across GL accounts and did not find the split under the table; invoices are
  often shared out in dollars, and a percentage of 56.18% to get 500.00 is error-prone. Where: `coding/review.py`
  `split_line(by=)`, `web/pages/invoice.py` `split`, the popover in `web/templates/invoice.html`,
  `static/js/invoice.js`; tests `tests/coding/test_split.py`, `tests/web/test_web_picker.py`.
- **D-127** · The demo release: a demo runs AP Coder on a data folder of its own, `scripts\demo.bat`
  (`AP_PRIVATE_DIR=%USERPROFILE%\APCoder-demo`, never recorded: the usual double-click keeps the pilot tester's
  data; in `scripts\` as the app folder's top holds one file to open per computer), with the ten samples imported
  and two more invoices in `samples/demo_day/` (made by `scripts/make_sample_pdf.py`, left out of the self-check):
  Pacific Office Supply's next invoice, coded from the approval of PO-77120, and PO-77120 sent again, stopped as a
  duplicate. `docs/DEMO_RUN_SHEET.md` is the one page to follow, `docs/KNOWN_LIMITS.md` what it does not do yet.
  CI proves it on the offline bundle on Windows with the internet cut off: installed with LM Studio (a stand-in)
  running and the right model for each job, `scripts\demo.bat` keeping its own folder, and
  `tests/ops/test_demo_day.py` (import to Excel export). Why: the pilot tester's laptop may hold their own AP Coder
  data, where the samples would be skipped as already in AP Coder; a rehearsal is put back with a backup restore.
  The version stays 0.3.0; the release is the git tag `v0.3.0-pilot1` and its bundle, told apart by its build stamp.
- **D-128** · The handoff to the company's own AI coding agent is one way and complete: `docs/HANDOFF.md` is its
  brief (getting the code in, run and test, the code's map, sample vs real data, each connection point with what the
  company supplies, the order of work, the house rules), written so that nothing need be asked back. It travels
  as a git bundle (`main` with its whole history and the tags) and as a plain zip of `main`, with HANDOFF.md beside
  them and their SHA-256. The company's copy becomes the main one. No company data travels: the company's values
  are gathered inside the company (the JDE worksheet) and imported into the data folder. `CLAUDE.md` and the README
  point to HANDOFF.md first.
- **D-129** · A release is tagged by CI once its laptop is checked with the real LM Studio: `.github/release-tags.txt`
  lists the tags (tag, commit, title), and `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the pilot release's offline install
  zip from its commit, installs it on Windows with LM Studio running headless (llmster) with the pilot laptop's
  models on the CPU, double-clicks `scripts\demo.bat` with the internet cut off and runs the run sheet against the
  running dashboard: `tests/ops/test_demo_day.py` with `AP_DEMO_DAY_URL` waits for OvisOCR2 to pass its self-test and
  checks that the chat model coded every sample invoice. On main it then creates each missing tag and its GitHub
  release, the checked zip attached to the pilot's. Why: a stand-in proved the install, not the real models on
  Windows, and only CI may push tags here. Slow, so it runs only when the workflow or the tag list changes.
- **D-130** · A pilot release is checked on the laptop once, not once per run: the Release workflow's first job
  keys what its check checks (`scripts/ci/release_key.py`: the newest pilot release's tag and commit, the check
  job's runner, time limit, environment and steps, and `tests/ops/test_demo_day.py`) and looks for a passed run
  with the same key whose zip is still kept (14 days). Found, the check is skipped and the tags job attaches that
  run's zip. A release's pull request runs the check; its merge to main reuses it (it ran twice, 60 to 90 minutes
  each, on the CPU). A release keeps the zip it was first given (no `--clobber`): its checksum never changes after
  it is published. Why not key on the files alone: the zip is built from the pilot's commit, so a release reuses
  only a check of that same commit.
- **D-131** · The local model's account suggestions are kept in the data folder (`.cache/model_accounts`), one file
  per exact question (model, lines, history and lessons, chart), so the page reader's pass never asks what arrival
  asked: with a graphics card every invoice was read again and coded twice, the same answer at temperature 0, and a
  second request that failed (the model busy or unloaded beside OvisOCR2) blanked the accounts the invoice had. A
  question that changed (an approval or a lesson since, other lines read off the page) is asked again, so what AP
  taught applies. Only the app's pipeline keeps them: the doctor's dry run and the coding bench still ask the model.
